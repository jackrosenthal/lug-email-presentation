Title: Email and Email Servers
Description: >
    Every day, our lives continue to exist because of Email. Imagine the news
    if Email suddenly stopped working! Some people even use Email
    [to get ahold of emergency services](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EBfxjSFAxQ).

    This talk goes over how Email functions as a non-centralized system
    (conceptually), as well as how to setup an Email system on Linux using
    Postfix and Dovecot.
